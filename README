This project has two implementations for classification of catergorical datasets
1. Building decision tree using ID3 implementation
2. Random Forest Algorithm

ID3 algorithm uses informtation gain and entropy for its calculations.
Random Forest can be built in two ways - using random row sampling or column sampling. I have implemented both the ways.
While executing the algorithm, we can call either of them by calling the appropriate functions.

Below are few of the data sets used for testing -
1. Nursery.csv
2. car.csv
3. Mushroom.csv

For ID3 Algorithm, I used 80% of the data for training and used the remaining 20% for testing. There is no overlap between the training and test data.
For Random Forest(sampling rows). I used random sampling with replacement using 20% of the data for training  and used the same test data created for ID3 Algorithm.

I provided test results using both the models for the above datasets.
